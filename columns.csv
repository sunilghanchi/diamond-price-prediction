Column Name,Description
cut,cut refers to one of the 10 or so most common diamond cuts. This dataset has an additional one called the 'Cushion Modified'.
color,Clear diamonds are graded D-Z. The higher letters more yellowish but are often better values since color is hard to determine once in a ring.
clarity,"clarity refers the inclusions (i.e., internal flaws) in the diamonds seen though a jewelers loupe or microscope. Fewer and smaller are better."
carat_weight,carat_weight Refers to the mass of the diamond. It's loosely connected with dimension of a diamond but cut and cut_quality tends to play an equally large if not larger role.
cut_quality,cut_quality refers the GIA Cut Grading System which was developed in 2005 and is de facto standard.
lab,"lab is the grading lab. The big three are GIA, IGI and HRD. Each diamond gets a lab certificate that looks like this."
table_percent,table_percent are the relative measurements of the flat part of the top and the depth. This varies somewhat by cut.
symmetry,polish and symmetry are what you would expect.
polish,polish and symmetry are what you would expect.
meas_length,the absolute length measurements of stone.
meas_width,the absolute width measurements of stone.
meas_depth,the absolute depth measurements of stone.
total_sales_price,total_sales_price is priced in dollars.
